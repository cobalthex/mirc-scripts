Version 1.40 - July 20th 2002
-
Fixes Include:
- Fixed the titlebar bug that would stop new users from succesfully installing. The bug accidently occured when making changes to the
Speed Test in Version 1.30
- Fixed the Server Description Bug where old descriptions were combined with new ones.
- An ingame message now displays during games when there is no UDP data coming from the server.
- Fixed bandwidth dialog problem, alias accidently removed whilst creating trigger one.
- Fixed 2 silly if-then-else statement bugs in the update section
- Fixed the server compile bug where a user left and then another one joined only to have some of the old users
udp data still cached.
- The game now checks to see that your computer is running a screen resolution of 1024 * 768 or higher on load. 
- Fixed energy bar bug where the energy speed would be the same speed for all users. Now the
energy bar will be included in the speed test settings.
- Game performance increased by at least 50% for players who are having speed problems.
The processing timer now starts before the drawing timer which means mIRC gives priority
to processing rather than to drawing so now you dont have seconds of lag, where nothing locally-processed moves.
- /spacefighter -mm now opens the MapMaker
